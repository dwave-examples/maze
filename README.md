# Maze

Getting the D-Wave quantum computer to solve a maze!

The following code takes a simple and familiar problem---solving a maze---and
demonstrates the steps of submitting such problems to the quantum computer.

```bash
#|#######
#._._. .#
#  # |  #
#. . ._.#
#      |#
#. .#. ._
#########
```

The above ASCII figure is a visualization of a maze and a maze path returned as
samples from the QPU. The hashes (#) represent maze walls, the pipes (|) and
underscores (_) mark the maze path, and the periods (.) act as gridpoints for
this maze.

## Usage

```bash
python demo.py
```

Returns ASCII visual of the maze and a QPU sampled maze path. As well, there is
a printout of the path segments and their associated boolean value (see [Code
Specifics - Result Interpretation](#Result-Interpretation) for details).

## Code Overview

The solution technique is to construct a set of constraints that enforces the
rules of moving through a maze. These constraints are then converted by Ocean
software tools to a binary quadratic model (BQM) that can then be solved with
a D-Wave quantum computer. The solution that gets returned by the quantum
computer is the path needed to get through the maze.

There are several constraints involved with a maze:

- Valid path movements (i.e., if the path enters a grid point, it must also
  leave said grid point)
- Path has a specific start and end position
- Path cannot pass maze borders
- Path cannot pass through the internal walls of the maze

Each of these constraints get implemented when the user calls Maze's
`get_bqm()`.

## Code Specifics

### Coordinate Notation

The maze is a rectangular grid. The path segments (aka edges) that can be
formed in this grid are described with respect to a grid point. For example,
the edge labelled `'1,0w'`:

- `1,0` refers to a grid point on row 1, column 0
- `w` refers to "west"

Hence, if you imagine a compass that is centered at position `1,0`, the edge
`'1,0w'` is the path segment that sits along the western direction of this
compass.

Note that the code only accepts edge inputs in the north direction
(`'<row>,<col>n'`) and the west direction (`'<row>,<col>w'`). Edges in
south or east directions can be restated as edges in north and west directions:

```python
'<row>,<col>s' == '<row+1>,<col>n'
'<row>,<col>e' == '<row>,<col+1>w'
```

### Result Interpretation

Consider the following 2 by 2 maze with

- start = `'0,0n'`
- end = `'1,0w'`
- walls = `['1,1n']`

This can be visualized as the following maze. Note that the periods (.) act
as gridpoints, which means that the maze below has 2 rows and 2 columns.

```bash
#|###     <-- start location ('0,0n'); the path "north" of coordinate 0,0
#. .#
#  ##     <-- wall ('1,1n'); blocks the path "north" of coordinate 1,1
_. .#     <-- end location; the path "west" of coordinate 1,0
#####
```

When running the demo code and submitting this problem, the following result
would be produced:

```bash
#|###
#. .#
#| ##
_. .#
#####

    1,0n  0,1w  1,1w  energy  num_occ.  chain_b.
0     1     0     0    -3.5      1000       0.0
```

Comments on the printed result:

- The 1s and 0s beneath each path segment indicate whether or not the
  segment is included in the path. Specifically, 1 indicates that the segment
  contributes to the path, while 0 indicates otherwise.
- As shown above, `'1,0n'` is a segment that is needed in our tiny maze path
- Hence, the path from start to end is `'0,0n' -> '1,0n' -> '1,0w'`
